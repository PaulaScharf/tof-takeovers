Here are some original unlabeled videos recorded by Luca and Paula.

## luca/
### Autos.csv
Luca recorded cars overtaking him while driving his bicycle on a busy street. We are unsure wether to use this file for training or not, because it has some artifacts on the bottom of the field of view of the sensor. Currently the file is not used for training.

### Fahrraeder.csv
Luca very slowly drove along the Promenade and recorded other cyclists overtaking him.

### reverseData.csv
Luca drove past parked cars. This video is intended (!) to be reversed.

## paula/
### autos_1.csv, autos_2.csv, autos_3.csv, autos_4.csv, autos_5.csv
Paula drove past parked cars with the sensor orientation reversed. For the sensor it looks like the recorded cars are overtaking.

### indoor_turning.csv
Paula recorded this inside her office. No takeovers are visible in this video.
