## luca/
The file `Fahrraeder.csv` was recorded by Luca. He very slowly drove along the Promenade and recorded other cyclists overtaking him. The files `Fahrraeder_reversed.csv`, `Fahrraeder_90.csv` and `Fahrraeder_270.csv` are versions of the original `Fahrraeder.csv`, where the videos are rotated. All labels in the latter three videos are 'no takeover' (0).

## paula/
### autos_1.csv, autos_2.csv, autos_3.csv, autos_4.csv, autos_5.csv, autos_6.csv, autos_7.csv
Paula drove past parked cars and reversed the sensor orientation, so that it looks like the cars are overtaking. Compared to their unlabeled counterparts, these files have their beginnings and ends removed, as these are mostly empty.

### indoor_turning.csv
Paula recorded this inside her office. No takeovers are visible in this video.
