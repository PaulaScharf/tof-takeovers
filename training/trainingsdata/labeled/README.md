### Fahrraeder_Promenade
The file `Fahrraeder.csv` was recorded by Luca. He very slowly drove along the Promenade and recorded other cyclists overtaking him. The files `Fahrraeder_reversed.csv`, `Fahrraeder_90.csv` and `Fahrraeder_270.csv` are versions of the original `Fahrraeder.csv`, where the videos are rotated. All labels in the latter three videos are 'no takeover' (0).

### indoor_turning.csv
Paula recorded this in the office at ifgi. No takeovers are visible in this video.
